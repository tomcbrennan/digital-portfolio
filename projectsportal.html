              Project Sportal provides users with a hub of listed sporting
              activities from other users at campus. The dashboard screen of the
              app invites users to explore the live mapping feature, with
              visualised sport listings from other students on campus. Listings
              are displayed at the location that the host has specified, with an
              icon for the respective sporting activity.

            <p>
              Curtin University contains a plethora of sporting facilities that
              are available for use by students. Project Sportal allows students
              to list their own sporting activities during their free time in
              study breaks or inbetween classes. The aim of this process is to
              make exercising a more social and inclusive activity that
              encourages those who do not particularly enjoy exercisng. The
              ability to list your own activity reduces the constraints that
              other forced fitness activities may implement.

        <h1>What did I learn?</h1>
        <p>
          Project Sportal presented me with my first concrete opportunity to
          improve my ability in collating user research and produce an overall
          solution that adhered to this research. More specifically, being a
          problem primarily targeted at students on campus, I was able to easily
          obtain the wants, needs and perspectives of students that aided my
          proposed solution immensely. Furthermore, throughout the prototyping
          process, I was able to experiment with using programs that were
          previously so foreign to me. Initial prototypes were constructed using
          Figma, with the final solution and micro-animations made possible with
          Adobe XD. With software like these being heavily used throughout
          modern design industry, I was pleased to be able to develop these
          vital skills during the development of Project Sportal.
