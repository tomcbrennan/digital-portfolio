         <h1>The Problem</h1>
          <p>
            As an avid sports fan, I've seen my fair share of websites for
            different sports leagues around the world.
            When evaluating the recent website reskinning for English Premier
            League Football, I found it to be an underwhelming design, with an
            overcrowding of assets and an inconsistent user experience overall.
            As a result of this, I resort to other websites to source the latest
            news and results.
            For any sporting website around the world, as a bare minimum, users
            want clear representation of the latest scores, fixtures and
            standings.

        <div class="pl-text">
          <div class="pl-text-description" data-aos="fade-up">
            <p>
              The devised solution was to create a desktop and mobile friendly
              web application that utilises a backend API to source all
              necessary results, fixtures and standings. As the user navigates,
              the latest data is fetched from API Football and displayed,
              respective of which tab they are viewing. Within the results page,
              live matches are displayed first, followed by the latest results
              in chronological order.

              <div class="pl-grid-box">

            <p>
              Throughout the design process, I aimed to put a strong emphasis on
              the visual experience, ensuring users feel the same excitement
              using the web application as they do when whitnessing the Premier
              League in action. A concious decision to enhance this factor is
              the minimised navbar design. This ensures that users are given
              maximum viewing space on the website to view the most important
              content as easily as possible.

            Adhering to the current Premier League branding was at the core of
            the design. The vibrant colour palette lends itself to implement
            some creative flair, and so I attempted to add bursts of the
            brighter colours within their palette where possible. Examples of
            this are the green nav menu and pink hover events over buttons. The
            overall intention of this is to gain user attention and reflect the
            exciting and diverse nature of not only the league, but also the
            teams and their fans.

        <h1>What did I learn?</h1>
        <p>A key take away from this project was the realisation of just how robust and polished a website becomes with incorporating a rich external API into the design. Furthermore, the ability to manipulate JSON data to ensure that the website functions just how I originally intended is eye opening. It is extremely reassuring to knowing that there are so many powerful API's to source from around the web and that I now have the a base understanding of how these are implemented. I am extremely proud of this project's outcome, and have used it on numerous occasions to check the latest scores and standings from the league on both mobile and desktop. I strongly believe that there are endless possibilities from here in terms of building on the application. Through further iterations, I would love to include modals of matches, featuring key match events and scores at different periods of the games.</p>
